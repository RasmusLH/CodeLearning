    "### Hash Tables\n",

    "Ideally, it distributes keys evenly across the available slots creating a uniform distribution.\n",
    "The function should compute hashes quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The computed hash directs the lookup to a particular bucket or slot in an underlying array.\n",
    "Multiple keys might hash to the same bucket, leading to collisions.\n",

    "3. Collision resolution\n",
    "Chaining: Each bucket contains a linked list of all key-value pairs that hashed to that index.\n",
    "Open addressing: When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next free slot using a method like linear probing."

    "### Contrarian and Non-Obvious Insights\n",
    "1. Predictability vs. Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "While hash tables offer excellent performance for most applications, the predictability of hash functions can become a liability in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., hash flooding attacks). In such cases, randomized hash functions or alternative data structures may be used to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Overhead and Cache Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables typically require extra memory for storing pointers and managing collisions (e.g., in chaining). Although the average time complexity is \n",
    "ùëÇ\n",
    "(\n",
    "1\n",
    ")\n",
    "O(1), this extra memory and the non-contiguous memory access patterns can lead to cache misses, which might affect performance in high-throughput applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Alternative Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the use case, other data structures like balanced binary search trees (e.g., red-black trees) might be preferred, especially when order matters or when worst-case guarantees are critical. For instance, Java‚Äôs TreeMap maintains order at the cost of \n",
    "ùëÇ\n",
    "(\n",
    "log\n",
    "‚Å°\n",
    "ùëõ\n",
    ")\n",
    "O(logn) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Trade-offs in Dynamic Resizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic resizing of a hash table (to maintain a low load factor) is essential for performance but can lead to occasional performance hits during the rehashing process. In high-performance systems, understanding and tuning these behaviors (or even implementing custom hash tables) might be necessary."
